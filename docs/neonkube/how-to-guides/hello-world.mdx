# Hello World Example

This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a simple application to a NeonKUBE
cluster.

## Clone demo repository

```plain
git clone https://github.com/nforgeio/neonKUBE-demos.git
```

## Publish images

NeonKUBE Clusters include a built-in container registry to store images for
deployment. In this step we'll publish the necessary container images to the
Cluster Registry.

:::note
You can optionally build the containers yourself, rather than using the public
images. To do this, add the `-build` flag to the following command. You'll need
to have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and the .NET SDK
installed to do this.
:::

```plain
powershell -f publish.ps1
```

## Deploy hello-world-operator

```plain
neon apply -f hello-world-operator.yaml
```

## Deploy hello-world

You can edit the `hello-world.yaml` spec to change the deployment behaviour.

```yaml
apiVersion: demo.neonkube.io/v1alpha1
kind: HelloWorldDemo
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  labels:
    app: hello-world
spec:
  logLevel: debug
  helloWorldReplicas: 2
  loadGeneratorReplicas: 3
  storageType: ephemeral # ephemeral or nfs
  ssoEnabled: false
  neonDashboardEnabled: false
```

```plain
neon apply -f hello-world.yaml
```

## View Hello, World!

:::info HTTPS!

Every NeonKUBE Cluster comes with an SSL certificate to make it easy to deploy
new services. The Hello World demo is deployed using this certificate.

:::

<Tabs groupId="deployment">
  <TabItem value="desktop" label="NeonDESKTOP">
    Open:{" "}
    <a href="https://hello-world.desktop.neoncluster.io">
      https://hello-world.desktop.neoncluster.io
    </a>
    .
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kube" label="NeonKUBE">
    Use the following command to get the URL for Hello, World!, and open it in
    your browser.
    <br />
    <br />
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`powershell -c "Write-Host (('https://hello-world.', (neon cluster info | ConvertFrom-Json).Domain) -join '')"`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## HelloWorldDemo Options

The `HelloWorldDemo` Custom Resource `spec` allows for configuration of the
demo. These options can be changed at any time by modifying the
`hello-world.yaml` manifest and applying the changes with
`neon apply -f hello-world.yaml`.

### `logLevel`

`logLevel` can be set to the following:

- CRITICAL
- ERROR
- WARNING
- INFORMATION
- DEBUG
- TRACE

### `helloWorldReplicas`

This is the number of replicas that will be deployed for the `hello-world` web
app.

### `loadGeneratorReplicas`

This is the number of replicas for the load generator app. Increase this to
generate more load.

### `storageType`

storageType can be set to `ephemeral` or `nfs`.

The `hello-world` app has a `/storage` page where users can update a text file.
This can be used to verify the behaviours described below. Try updating the text
file and killing some pods with the "Kill Pods" button to see what happens.

- `ephemeral` does not create any Kubernetes
  [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).
  Each pod has its own ephemeral volume, and any data stored on it will be lost
  when the pod is deleted.
- `nfs` Creates a persistent volume that is shared between all `hello-world`
  pods as described
  [here](http://localhost:3000/docs/neonkube/volumes-storage#network-file-system).
  In this mode, any data stored on the Volume will be persisted.

### `ssoEnabled`

If set to true, the Operator will configure the `hello-world` demo to use Neon
Single Sign On. Users will need cluster credentials to access the demo.

### `neonDashboardEnabled`

If set to true, the Operator will add a link to the `hello-world` dashboard to
the NeonKUBE dashboard.
