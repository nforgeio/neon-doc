# Deploy on Azure

## Prerequisites

- Install NeonDESKTOP: [instructions](./neon-desktop)
- You'll also need to know your **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID**

  $todo(jefflill): document how to obtain this

## Azure Subscription Credentials

NeonKUBE will need your Azure subscription credentials so it will be able to
deploy and manage the cluster. You'll also need to accept the NeonKUBE offer
EULA on Azure.

Install the
[Azure CLI](https://api-docs.neonforge.com/neonkube/api/Neon.Kube.ClusterDef.ClusterDefinition.html).

Run the following command to obtain your subscription credentials (you'll need to subsitute
your Azure username for **[USER]** and your Azure subscription ID for **[AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID]** below):

```plain
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name [USER] --role owner --scopes /subscriptions/[AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID]
```

The output will be something like:

```json
{
  "appId": "[AZURE_CLIENT_ID]",
  "displayName": "example-app-name",
  "password": "[AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET]",
  "tenant": "[AZURE_TENANT_ID]"
}
```

We'll use the **[AZURE_CLIENT_ID]**, **[AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET]**, and
**[AZURE_TENANT_ID]** from the output plus the **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID** you
already know.

Next, you'll need to accept the NeonKUBE offer terms and EULA, via the
AZURE-CLI:

View the offer terms:

```plain
az vm image terms show --urn neonforge:neonkube:0-11-0-beta-0:0.11.0
```

Accept the terms

```plain
az vm image terms accept --urn neonforge:neonkube:0-11-0-beta-0:0.11.0
```

:::note
Azure doesn't directly support semantic versioning of their Virtual Machine
Images, so we have to do some version contortions to get this to work. We'll
probably add a NeonCLI command that figures out the version and then launches
AZURE-CLI with the correct paramweters.

The **0-11-0-beta-0:0.11.0** version part of the URN above is formatted with the first
part being the full semantic version of the release _0.11.0_ with all dots
replaced by dashes like _0-11-0_ and the second part being the **major**,
**minor**, and **patch** version of the release only.
:::

## Cluster Definition

Create a
[Cluster Definition](https://api-docs.neonforge.com/neonkube/api/Neon.Kube.ClusterDef.ClusterDefinition.html)
that describes the cluster.

:::warning
Make sure that the Azure account has enough
[Resource Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)
to deploy cluster virtual machines.
:::

Be sure to substitute the following from the previous steps:

- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

```yaml
name: my-azure-cluster
datacenter: westus2
hosting:
  environment: azure
  cloud:
    prefixResourceNames: default
  azure:
    subscriptionId: [AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID]
    tenantId: [AZURE_TENANT_ID]
    clientId: [AZURE_CLIENT_ID]
    clientSecret: [AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET]
    region: westus2
    defaultVmSize: Standard_E4vs_v5
nodes:
  control-0:
    role: control-plane
```

Save the modified cluster definition somewhere on your disk.

## Cluster Deployment via NeonDESKTOP

1. Right click the NeonDESKTOP icon in the taskbar > Deploy cluster

   <Image
     className="max-w-72 w-full"
     img={require("./assets/deploy-cluster.png")}
   />

2. Use the file picker to select the cluster definiton file you saved above

3. Grab a coffee and wait for NeonDESKTOP to deploy the cluster.

## Cluster Deployment via NeonCLI

Cluster deployment happens in two phases:

- Configuring the hosting infrastructure, which involves configuring the
  **Resource Group**, **Virtual Networl**, starting the **VMs**, configuring the
  **LoadBalancer**, **IP Addresses**, **Disks**, etc.

- Setting up the cluster. This involves configuring Linux and Kubernetes and
  then installing the necessary cluster components via Helm charts.

Execute the commands to deploy this cluster, passing the **PATH** to the cluster
definition file you saved above and **CLUSTERNAME** to the cluster name as
defined in the definition:

Prepare the cluster infrastructure

```plain
neon cluster prepare /path/to/your/cluster-definition.yaml
```

Setup the cluster

```plain
neon cluster setup sysadmin@my-azure-cluster
```

Then wait for cluster setup to complete.

:::note
These operations are currently coordinated by NeonDESKTOP or NeonCLI running on
your machine, so you'll need to keep your computer running and connected to the
network.

We plan on supporting cloud based deployment in the future where these
operations will be managed in the cloud, rather than from your computer.
