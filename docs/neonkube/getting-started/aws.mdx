# Deploy a NeonKUBE Cluster on AWS

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Accept the
  [NeonKUBE EULA](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/procurement?productId=e42b4534-a895-49d0-8c2e-1cafd10df38e)
- Your **AWS Access Key** and **Secret Key**

## Cluster Definition

First, you'll need to save this cluster definition as a YAML file on your
machine. This provisions a single node cluster in **us-west-2a** using a
**c5.2xlarge** based instance (currently, the NeonKUBE default instance size for
AWS).

```yaml
name: my-aws-cluster
hosting:
  environment: aws
  aws:
    accessKeyId: [ACCESS_KEY_ID]
    secretAccessKey: [SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
    availabilityZone: us-west-2a
    defaultEbsOptimized: true
nodes:
  control-0:
    role: control-plane
```

Save the cluster definition somewhere on your disk, being sure to substitute
your own AWS credentials for:

- **[ACCESS_KEY_ID]**
- **[SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]**

:::note
We plan on eventually integrating with AWS IAM Roles so AWS authntication will
be more secure.

## Cluster Deployment via NeonDESKTOP

1. Right click the NeonDESKTOP icon in the taskbar > Deploy cluster

   <Image
     className="max-w-72 w-full"
     img={require("./assets/deploy-cluster.png")}
   />

2. Use the file picker to select the cluster definiton file you saved above

3. Grab a coffee and wait for NeonDESKTOP to deploy the cluster.

## Cluster Deployment via NeonCLI

Cluster deployment happens in two phases:

- Configuring the hosting infrastructure, which involves configuring the
  **Resource Group**, **VPC**, starting the **Instances**, configuring the
  **LoadBalancer**, **IP Addresses**, **Disks**, etc.

- Setting up the cluster. This involves configuring Linux and Kubernetes and
  then installing the necessary cluster components via Helm charts.

Execute the commands to deploy this cluster, passing the **PATH** to the cluster
definition file you saved above and **CLUSTERNAME** to the cluster name as
defined in the definition:

Prepare the cluster infrastructure

```plain
neon cluster prepare /path/to/your/cluster-definition.yaml
```

Setup the cluster

```plain
neon cluster setup root@my-aws-cluster
```

Then wait for cluster setup to complete.

:::note
These operations are currently coordinated by NeonDESKTOP or NeonCLI running on
your machine, so you'll need to keep your computer running and connected to the
network.

We plan on supporting cloud based deployment in the future where these
operations will be managed in the cloud, rather than from your computer.
