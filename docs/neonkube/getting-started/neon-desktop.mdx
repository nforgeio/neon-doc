# Deploy with NeonDESKTOP

An easy way to get started with NeonKUBE and Kubernetes is to install
**NeonDESKTOP** and have it install a local desktop cluster.

:::note
NeonDESKTOP cluster **is not intended** for hosting production workloads.
:::

## Requirements

- Windows Home or Professional
- CPU: 4+ cores
- Disk: 500GB with 84GB free
- Memory: 32GB

## Installation

Download and run the NeonDESKTOP installer from one of our releases at:

https://github.com/nforgeio/neonKUBE/releases

This configures Hyper-V and also installs NeonDESKTOP. You may be prompted to
reboot your machine (e.g. when Hyper-V was not already installed and enabled).

NeonDESKTOP will prompt to deploy a local desktop cluster the first time it
runs. You can choose to do this right away or later via the NeonDESKTOP taskbar
menu.

## Operations

After a cluster is deployed, you can use the taskbar menu to perform operations
like: starting, stopping, pausing, removing, displaying dashboards, etc. You'll
also be able to use the **neon** command line tool to manipulate the cluster.

:::note
The dashboards are secured by free TLS certificates generated by our integration
with [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and
[ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/) as well as a user ID and password.

NeonKUBE includes the infrastructure required to authenticate users against
external OAuth providers like GitHub, Google, Microsoft as well as enterprise
solutions like Active Directory. Unfortunately, we haven't enabled this support
yet so we rely on internal cluster authentication against a **root** user.

We currently generate a secure password for the **root** user. You can obtain
this using the NeonDESKTOP **Copy/SSO password to clipboard** menu and then
pasting that into the dashboard's login window. For clusters deployed via
NeonCLI, you can locate the SSO password by searching for **"ssoPassword"** in
the Kubernetes config file located at:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config
```

This isn't ideal or particularily secure and we plan on improving the
installation process by integrating with external OAuth providers or at least
prompting the user for a password rather than autogenerating one.

## Cluster Hostname and IP Address

The NeonDESKTOP virtual machine deployed to your computer can be accessed
using the **neon-desktop** hostname or it's **100.64.0.254** IP address.

The SSH credentials for the virtual machine are:

username: **sysadmin**
password: **sysadmin0000**

:::note
Your NeonDESKTOP cluster can **only be accessed from your computer**.
Access from **external devices via the LAN will be blocked**.

This means that your NeonDESKTOP cluster will be as secure as your
host computer.

It's not currently possible to access the desktop cluster from smartphones
or other pyhysical devices.  One workaround is to use a smartphone development
emulator running on the same computer (which can be convienent when debugging).
