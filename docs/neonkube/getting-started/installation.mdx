# Installation

NeonKUBE releases are located in our NeonKUBE GitHub Repository here:

https://github.com/nforgeio/neonKUBE/releases

Click on a release (generally the most recent) and then scroll down to the
bottom of the release page to locate the **Assets**:

  img={require("./assets/installation/github-release.png")}
/>

You'll find the two installer downloads there, one that installs the **NeonCLI**
tool (a gently extended version of the Kubernetes **kubectl** client). Note that
this also installs other Kubernetes related tools like **Helm** and
**Kustomize**.

:::note

Both of these installers currently target **only Microsoft Windows**. We're
planning on supporting NeonCLI on macOS and Linux (which should be relatively
easy) and are considering having NeonDESKTOP support macOS in the future (which
will be harder).

:::

Download and run **neon-cli.#-win.amd64.exe** to install **NeonCLI** and then
open a new command window to pick up the new environment variables such as
**PATH**.

:::note

The NeonCLI tool is named: **neon**

:::

You can verify the installation by having NeonCLI print out its version:

```plain
C:\ neon version --client
Client Version: v1.24.14-68+c20ccd7b9b29b3
Kustomize Version: v4.5.4
neon-cli Version: 0.11.0
Helm Version: 3.12.0
```

Download and run **neon-desktop.#-win.amd64.exe** to install **NeonDESKTOP** as
well as **NeonCLI**, which is included. Note that NeonDESKTOP lives in the
Windows taskbar:

<Image
  className="w-full max-w-2xl"
  img={require("./assets/installation/desktop-taskbar.png")}
/>
This is the NeonDESKTOP icon. It will be **green** when connected to a cluster, **blinking
yellow** when an operation is in progress, **red** when there's a problem with the
current cluster, and **clear** when not connected to a cluster. Right-click on this
icon to display the application menu.
