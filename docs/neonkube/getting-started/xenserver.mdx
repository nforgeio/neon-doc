# Deploy on XenServer/XCP-ng

You'll need a machine running either the XenServer or XCP-ng hypervisor.
[XenServer](https://xenserver.com) is a commercial offering that used to have a
free edition but now only has a time-limited trial. [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org)
is an open source fork of the XenServer project, back when it was open source
too.  
XCP-ng is completely free.

We've been using **XCP-ng for about 5 years** now and have been happy with it.

You'll need an AMD64 compatible computer for this. This doesn't need to be
particularily high powered but should minimially have:

- cpu: 4 cores
- memory: 16+ GB
- disk: 500GB SSD

**XenServer/XCP-ng v8.2+** is required.

Download and install either **XenServer** or **XCP-ng**, following the
instructions on the respwctive site. Make a note of the **IP Address** assigned
to the machine as well as the **root password** you created.

# Deploy a NeonKUBE Cluster on AZURE

### Cluster Definition

First, you'll need to save this cluster definition as a YAML file on your
machine. This provisions a single node cluster on your Xen machine.

Be sure to make these substitutions first:

- **[XEN_HOST_PASSWORD]**: change this to the root password you created when you
  deployed the Xen machine.

- **[XEN_HOST_ADDRESS]**: change this to the Xen machine's IP address.

- **Network:** change **network.gateway** and **network.premiseSubnet** to the
  settings for your local LAN and also set **nodes.control-0.address** to an
  unused address on the LAN.

```yaml
name: my-xen-cluster
hosting:
  environment: xenserver
  vm:
    hostUsername: root
    hostPassword: [XEN_HOST_PASSWORD]
    namePrefix: vm_prefix
    hosts:
      - name: MY-XEN-SERVER
        address: [XEN_HOST_ADDRESS]
network:
  gateway: 10.100.0.1
  premiseSubnet: 10.100.0.0/16
nodes:
  control-0:
    role: control-plane
    address: 10.100.1.100
    vm:
      host: MY-XEN-SERVER
      cores: 4
      memory: 8GiB
      osDisk: 64GiB
```

## Cluster Deployment via NeonDESKTOP

1. Right click the NeonDESKTOP icon in the taskbar > Deploy cluster

   <Image
     className="max-w-72 w-full"
     img={require("./assets/deploy-cluster.png")}
   />

2. Use the file picker to select the cluster definiton file you saved above

3. Grab a coffee and wait for NeonDESKTOP to deploy the cluster.

## Cluster Deployment via NeonCLI

Cluster deployment happens in two phases:

- Configuring the hosting infrastructure, which involves configuring the
  **Resource Group**, **VPC**, starting the **Instances**, configuring the
  **LoadBalancer**, **IP Addresses**, **Disks**, etc.

- Setting up the cluster. This involves configuring Linux and Kubernetes and
  then installing the necessary cluster components via Helm charts.

Execute the commands to deploy this cluster, passing the **PATH** to the cluster
definition file you saved above and **CLUSTERNAME** to the cluster name as
defined in the definition:

Prepare the cluster infrastructure (change PATH to your cluster definition path)

```plain
neon cluster prepare /path/to/your/cluster-definition.yaml
```

Setup the cluster

```plain
neon cluster setup root@my-xen-cluster
```

Then wait for cluster setup to complete.

:::note
These operations are currently coordinated by NeonDESKTOP or NeonCLI running on
your machine, so you'll need to keep your computer running and connected to the
network.

We plan on supporting cloud based deployment in the future where these
operations will be managed in the cloud, rather than from your computer.
