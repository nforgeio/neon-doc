# Networking

## Istio

Istio is an open source service mesh that provides a uniform way to connect,
secure, control and observe services running on Kubernetes clusters. By using
Istio on neonKUBE clusters, developers can benefit from advanced features such
as traffic management, security policies, telemetry and observability.

### Ingress

Ingress can be configured by creating `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources.
All NeonKUBE clusters are configured with a secure `Gateway` by default to allow
users to get up and running quickly without having to manage DNS and
certificates.

Here is an example `VirtualService` that uses the default `neoncluster-gateway`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
spec:
  gateways:
    - neon-ingress/neoncluster-gateway
  hosts:
    - example.CLUSTER_ID.neoncluster.io
  http:
    - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: example.default.svc.cluster.local
            port:
              number: 80
```
