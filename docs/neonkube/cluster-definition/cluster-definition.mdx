# Cluster Definition

This documentation section describes the cluster definition format in detail. Here's the top-level structure of a
cluster definition:

```yaml
ClusterDefinition:
  annotations:  [map]
  container:    {}
  datacenter:   null
  deployment:   {}
  description:  null
  features:     {}
  hosting:      {}
  isDesktop:    false
  jobs:         {}
  kubelet:      {}
  latitude:     null
  longitude:    null
  monitor:      {}
  name:         [required]
  network:      {}
  nodeOptions:  {}
  nodes:        [map]
  packageProxy: null
  purpose:      "unspecified"
  resourceTags: []
  security:     {}
  storage:      {}
  timeSources:  ["pool.ntp.org"]
```

    <tr>
        <td><b>annotations</b></td>
        <td>
            `map:` Optionally specifies cluster annotations.  Label names and values must follow the
            [Kubernetes conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
            and the <b>neonkube.io/</b> prefix is reserved by NeonKUBE.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>datacenter</b></td>
        <td>
            `string:` Identifies the datacenter.  This defaults to empty string for on-premise clusters
            or the region for clusters deployed to the cloud.

            <b>NOTE:</b> The name may include only letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.

            between -90 and +90 degrees.

            <b>NOTE:</b> <b>Latitude</b> and <b>Longitude</b> must both be specified together or
            not at all.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>longitude</b></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>name</b></td>
        <td>
        `string:` Specifies the cluster name.

        <b>NOTE:</b>
        Names may include only letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores and
        may be up to 24 characters long.  Some hosting environments enforce length limits
        on resource names that we derive from the cluster name, so please limit your
        cluster name to 24 characters.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>network</b></td>
        <td>

        <td>
            `object:` Specifies host node options, including Linux package manager settings.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>nodes</b></td>
        <td>

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>packageProxy</b></td>
        <td>
            `string:` Optionally specifies one or more APT proxy/cache servers the cluster will use to install
            and update Linux packages.  These are endpoints like <b>HOSTNAME:PORT</b> or <b>ADDRESS.PORT</b>
            of a <b>apt-cacher-ng</b> or other package proxy server.  The port is generally set to <b>3142</b>
            Multiple proxies may be specified by separating them with spaces.  This defaults to
            referencing the <b>apt-cacher-ng</b> instances running on the control-plane nodes.

            <b>NOTE:</b>
            The cluster nodes are configured to failover to different proxies or to hit the
            default Linux distribution package mirror directly if any or all of the caches
            specified are unavailable.

            The package caches will be tried in the order they are listed.  This essentially
            makes the first cache primary, with the others acting as backups.

        <td>
                `array:` Optionally specifies custom tags that will be attached to cluster resources in cloud
                hosting environments.  These tags are intended to help you manage your cloud resources
                as well as help organize your cost reporting.

                <b>NOTE:</b> Currently, this is only supported for clusters deployed to AWS and Azure.
