# Network Options

Describes the network options for a cluster.

Here's what the network options look like, with the default values or
**[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
network:
  acme:
    certificateDuration:    "2160h0m0s"
    certificateRenewBefore: "720h0m0s"
    issuer:                 null
  egressAddressRules:       []
  gateway:                  [second address in premiseSubnet]
  ingressHealthCheck:
    intervalSeconds:        10
    thresholdCount:         2
  ingressRules:             []
  managementAddressRules:   []
  mutalPodTls:              false
  nameServers:
  - "8.8.8.8"               [Google DNS for on-premise]
  - "8.8.4.4"               [otherwise use cloud DNS  ]
  nodeMtu:                  0
  premiseSubnet:            [required for on-premise]
  podSubnet:                "10.254.0.0/16"

                `string:` Optionally specifies the certificate issuer, including any configuration required by the issuer.
                This defaults to **null** which enables the standard NeonKUBE certificate issuer.

                when the property is **null** or empty.  See [Address Rules](#address-rules)
                below for more information.
        
                **NOTE:** Address rules are processed in order from first to last, so you may 
                consider putting your blacklist rules before your whitelist rules.
        
                **NOTE:** These rules currently apply to all network ports.
        
                **NOTE:** This is currently supported only for clusters hosted on Azure.  AWS doesn't support
                this scenario and we currently don't support automatic router configuration for
                on-premise environments.

                This defaults to the  second usable address in the **premiseSubnet**.  For example,
                for the **10.0.0.0/24** subnet, this will be default to **10.0.0.1**.

                `array:` Optionally specifies the ingress routing rules for external traffic received by nodes
                with **node.Ingress=true** enabled, targeting one or more Istio ingress gateway services 
                which are then responsible for routing to the target Kubernetes services.

                This defaults to allowing inbound **HTTP/HTTPS** traffic and cluster setup

                Here's how an address rule is structured:

                            **thresholdCount:** `integer:` Specifies the number of consecutive failed health checks before
                            the load balancer will consider the node endpoint to be unhealthy.  This defaults to **2** and
                            must be in the range of **2...10**

                            on **externalPort** will be forwarded.  The cluster's ingress gateway (Istio) will be
                            configured to listen for traffic on this port and route it into the cluster.

                        **tcp**, or **udp**.

                        This defaults to **tcp**.

                        <td>
                            `integer:` Specifies the target ingress port internal to the cluster.  The cluster's ingress gateway
                            (Istio) applies routing rules (virtual service) to the network traffic as it was received on
                            **targetPort**.  This decouples routing rules from **nNodePort** which may change for different
                            hosting environments.

                            This property is optional and defaults to zero, indicating that the traffic should
                            be routed to just the node port but **should not be routed through ingress gateway**.
                            This is useful for handling **UDP traffic** which Istio doesn't currently support and
                            perhaps some other scenarios.

                        <td>
                            `bool:` Optionally specifies whether the cluster router or load balancer sends a TCP RESET
                            packet to both ends of a TCP connection that has been idle for longer than **tcpIdleTimeoutMinutes**.
                            This defaults to **true**.

                            **NOTE:** At this point, this property is supported only in cloud environments where we
                            can easily control the cluster's external loag balancer.  This also has no
                            impact for the **udp** protocol.

                            `integer:` Optionally specifies the TCP idle time out for TCP related ingress protocols like
                            **http**, **https**, and **tcp**.  Inbound TCP connections that have no network
                            traffic going either way will be closed by supported load balancers or routers.
                            This defaults to **4 minutes**.

                            **NOTE:** At this point, this property is supported only in cloud environments where we
                            can easily control the cluster's external loag balancer.  This also has no impact for non-TCP rules.

                            **NOTE:** Cluster setup may modify this value to ensure that it honors the range of
                            values supported by the target cloud cloud.

                node management via SSH NAT rules as well as cluster management via the
                Kubernetes API via port 6443.  This defaults to allowing inbound traffic
                from anywhere when the property is <c>null</c> or empty.  See [Address Rules](#address-rules)
                below for more information.

                environments, this defaults to the [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns)

## Address Rules

<a name="address-rules" />

Address rules can be used white or blacklist external traffic to or from the
cluster. The network **egressAddressRules**, **ingressRules**, and
**managementAddressRules** properties above may be set to an array of address
rules to allow or deny traffic for a specific IP address or subnet.

Here's what an address rule looks like, with the default values or
**[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
action:          [required]
addressOrSubnet: [required]
```

**addressOrSubnet** specifies can specify a single IP address or a CIDR/subnet
specifying a range of IP addresses. This can also be set to **"any"** which
matches all possible IP addresses.

**action** can be set to **allow** or **deny**, where **allow** lets network
flow for the IP address(es) and **deny** blocks the traffic.

Rules are applied in the order they appear in the list where the first rule that
applies to the traffic's IP address will be applied. Traffic will be allowed
when no rule matches.
