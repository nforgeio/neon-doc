# Network Options

Describes the network options for a cluster.

Here's what the network options look like, with the default values or **[required]** for properties that must be
specified:

```yaml
network:
  acme:
    certificateDuration:    "2160h0m0s"
    certificateRenewBefore: "720h0m0s"
    issuer:                 null
  egressAddressRules:       []
  gateway:                  [second address in premiseSubnet]
  ingressHealthCheck:
    intervalSeconds:        10
    thresholdCount:         2
  ingressRules:             []
  managementAddressRules:   []
  mutalPodTls:              false
  nameServers:
  - "8.8.8.8"               [Google DNS for on-premise]
  - "8.8.4.4"               [otherwise use cloud DNS  ]
  nodeMtu:                  0
  premiseSubnet:            [required for on-premise]
  podSubnet:                "10.254.0.0/16"
  publicAddresses:          []
  reservedIngressEndPort:   64999
  reservedIngressStartPort: 64000
  serviceSubnet:            "10.253.0.0/16"
```

        <td>
            `string:` Optionally specifies the certificate issuer, including any configuration required by the issuer.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>egressAddressRules</b></td>
        <td>
            `array:` Optionally specifies whitelisted and/or blacklisted external addresses
            for outbound traffic.  This defaults to allowing outbound traffic to anywhere 
            when the property is **null** or empty.  See [Address Rules](#address-rules)
            below for more information.
        
            **NOTE:** Address rules are processed in order from first to last, so you may 
            consider putting your blacklist rules before your whitelist rules.
        
            **NOTE:** These rules currently apply to all network ports.
        
            **NOTE:** This is currently supported only for clusters hosted on Azure.  AWS doesn't support
            this scenario and we currently don't support automatic router configuration for
            on-premise environments.

    <tr>
        <td><b>gatewy</b></td>

            `string:` Specifies the default network gateway address to be configured for cluster nodes.
            This defaults to the  second usable address in the **premiseSubnet**.  For example,
            for the **10.0.0.0/24** subnet, this will be default to **10.0.0.1**.

            which are then responsible for routing to the target Kubernetes services.

            This defaults to allowing inbound **HTTP/HTTPS** traffic and cluster setup
            also adds a TCP rule for the Kubernetes API server on port **6442**.

            Here's how an address rule is structured:

                        checks.  This defaults to <b>10 seconds</b> and must be in the range of **10...300** seconds.

                        **thresholdCount:** `integer:` Specifies the number of consecutive failed health checks before
                        the load balancer will consider the node endpoint to be unhealthy.  This defaults to **2** and

                        on **externalPort** will be forwarded.  The cluster's ingress gateway (Istio) will be
                        configured to listen for traffic on this port and route it into the cluster.

                    **tcp**, or **udp**.

                    This defaults to **tcp**.

                    <td>
                        `integer:` Specifies the target ingress port internal to the cluster.  The cluster's ingress gateway
                        (Istio) applies routing rules (virtual service) to the network traffic as it was received on
                        **targetPort**.  This decouples routing rules from **nNodePort** which may change for different
                        hosting environments.

                        This property is optional and defaults to zero, indicating that the traffic should
                        be routed to just the node port but **should not be routed through ingress gateway**.
                        This is useful for handling **UDP traffic** which Istio doesn't currently support and
                        perhaps some other scenarios.

                        `bool:` Optionally specifies whether the cluster router or load balancer sends a TCP RESET
                        packet to both ends of a TCP connection that has been idle for longer than **tcpIdleTimeoutMinutes**.
                        This defaults to **true**.

                        **NOTE:** At this point, this property is supported only in cloud environments where we
                        can easily control the cluster's external loag balancer.  This also has no
                        impact for the **udp** protocol.

                        **http**, **https**, and **tcp**.  Inbound TCP connections that have no network
                        traffic going either way will be closed by supported load balancers or routers.
                        This defaults to **4 minutes**.

                        **NOTE:** At this point, this property is supported only in cloud environments where we
                        can easily control the cluster's external loag balancer.  This also has no impact for non-TCP rules.

                        **NOTE:** Cluster setup may modify this value to ensure that it honors the range of
                        values supported by the target cloud cloud.

            node management via SSH NAT rules as well as cluster management via the
            Kubernetes API via port 6443.  This defaults to allowing inbound traffic
            from anywhere when the property is <c>null</c> or empty.  See [Address Rules](#address-rules)

            **NOTE:** Address rules are processed in order from first to last, so you may

            environments, this defaults to the [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns)

## Address Rules

<a name="address-rules" />

Address rules can be used white or blacklist external traffic to or from the cluster. The network
**egressAddressRules**, **ingressRules**, and **managementAddressRules** properties above may be set to an array of
address rules to allow or deny traffic for a specific IP address or subnet.

Here's what an address rule looks like, with the default values or **[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
action:          [required]
addressOrSubnet: [required]
```

**addressOrSubnet** specifies can specify a single IP address or a CIDR/subnet specifying a range of IP addresses. This
can also be set to **"any"** which matches all possible IP addresses.

**action** can be set to **allow** or **deny**, where **allow** lets network flow for the IP address(es) and **deny**
blocks the traffic.

Rules are applied in the order they appear in the list where the first rule that applies to the traffic's IP address
will be applied. Traffic will be allowed when no rule matches.
