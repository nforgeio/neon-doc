# Job Options

Specifies enhanced Quartz cron schedules for NeonKUBE cluster jobs performed by
cluster operators such as **neon-cluster-operator**. Each job can be enabled or
disabled independently and scheduled using a CRON/Quartz like string, like:

```yaml
enabled:  true
schedule: "R R 0 ? * *"
```

**schedule** specifies the job schedule. This is extended Quartz CRON
expression.  
This defaults to **"R R 0 ? \* \*"** which fires every day at a random minute
and second between 12:00am and 1:00am.

Cron expressions consist of seven sub-expressions that describe the details of
the schedule. The sub expressions (in order) are:

- **Seconds** (0..59)
- **Minutes** (0..59)
- **Hours** (0..23)
- **Day-of-Month** (1..31)
- **Month** (1..12) or MON-DEC
- **Day-of-Week** (1..7) or SUN-SAT
- **Year** (optional) (1970..2099)

An example of a complete cron expression is **"0 0 15 ? \* MON"** which triggers
**every Monday at 3pm**.

For the full documentation which describes special characters, see:
[Quartz CRON Expressions](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/documentation/quartz-3.x/tutorial/crontriggers.html#cron-expressions)

:::note
In addition to the standard Quartz defined special characters, we also support
the <b>R</b> character which picks a random value within the allowed range for a
field. For example:

<b>"0 0 R R * *"</b>

schedules the job for a random hour and minute during the day. This is useful
for situations like uploading telemetry to a global service where you don't want
a potentially large number of clients being scheduled to hit the service at the
same time.

Here's what the cluster job options look like, with the default values or
**[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
jobs:
  controlPlaneCertificateRenewal:
    enabled:                        true
    schedule:                       "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  harborImagePush:
    enabled:                        true
    schedule:                       "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  linuxSecurityPatches:
    enabled:                        true
    schedule:                       "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  nodeCaCertificateRenewal:
    enabled:                        true
    schedule:                       "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  telemetryPing:
    enabled:                        true
    schedule:                       "R R 0 ? * *"
  terminatedPodGc:
    enabled:                        true
    schedule:                       "0 15 * * * *"
  terminatedPodGcDelayMilliseconds: 1000
  terminatedPodGcThresholdMinutes:  720
```
