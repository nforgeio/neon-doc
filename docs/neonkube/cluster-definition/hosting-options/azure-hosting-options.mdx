# Azure Hosting Options

Here's what the Azure related hosting options looks like, with the default values or **[required]** for property values
that must be specified:

                        `bool:` Optionally disables VM proximity placement.  This defaults to <c>false</c>.

                        NeonKUBE cluster VMs are all deployed within the same Azure [placement group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-proximity-placement-groups/)
                        by default.  This ensures the shortest possible network latency between the cluster VMs.

                        **NOTE:** Proximity placement groups have one downside: they make it more likely that Azure
                        may not be able to find enough unused VMs to satisfy the proximity constraints.  This
                        can happen when you first provision a cluster or later on when you try to scale one.

                        For NeonKUBE clusters the additional risk of an Azure provisioning failure is going
                        to be very low due to how we use availability sets, which is as similar deployment
                        constraint: control-plane nodes are deployed to one availability set and workers to another.
                        Without a proximity placement group, Azure could deploy the control-plane nodes to one datacenter
                        and the workers to another.  This wasn't that likely in the past but as Azure has
                        added more datacenters, the chance of this happening has increased.

                        Adding the proximity placement constrain, requires that Azure deploy both the control-plane nodes
                        and workers in the same datacenter.  So say your cluster has 3 control-plane nodes and 50 workers.
                        With proximity placement enabled, the Azure region will need to have a datacenter with
                        53 VMs available with the specified sizes.  With proximity placement disabled, Azure
                        could deploy the 3 control-plane nodes in one datacenter and the 50 workers in another.

                        **<u>network.egressPublicIpAddressId</u>**

                        Optionally specifies the ID of an existing public IPv4 address to be assigned
                        to the NAT Gateway for sending outboung network traffic.

                        **IMPORTANT:** This resource must be located in the same region as the cluster.

                        **NOTE:** Setting this is handy when clusters are reprovisioned because the cluster
                        will  end up using the same egress address as before, meaning you won't have to update
                        whitelist rules for other services, etc.

                        Optionally specifies the ID of an existing public IPv4 prefix to be assigned

                        **<u>network.egressPublicIpPrefixLength</u>**

                        Optionally indicates that a public IPv4 prefix with the specified prefix length should
                        be created and assigned to the NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.  Set this to a one of
                        the following non-zero values to enable this:

                        - **0** - **(default)**   disables prefix creation for the cluster
                        - **31** - creates a public IPv4 prefix with <b>2</b> public IP addresses
                        - **30** - creates a public IPv4 prefix with <b>4</b> public IP addresses

                        - **28** - creates a public IPv4 prefix with <b>16</b> public IP addresses (the maximum supported by Azure)

                        Larger clusters making lots of external network requests may need to select a prefix with additional IP addresses to avoid

                        to the load balancer to receive inbound network traffic.  A new address will
                        be created when this isn't specified.

                        inclusive.  This defaults to <b>120 minutes</b>.

                        **<u>network.nodeSubnet</u>**

                        Specifies the subnet where the cluster nodes will be provisioned.  This defaults to **10.100.0.0/24**.

                        distributed across.  This defaults to **20**  You may customize this with a value in the
                        range of: **2...20**

                        Azure automatically distributes VMs across the specified number of update
                        domains and when it's necessary to perform planned maintenance on the underlying
                        hardware or to relocate a VM to another host, Azure guarantees that it will
                        reboot hosts in only one update domain at a time and then wait 30 minutes between
                        update domains to give the application a chance to stabilize.

                        A value of **2** indicates that one half of the cluster servers may be rebooted
                        at the same time during an update domain upgrade.  A value of **20** indicates
                        that one twentieth of your VMs may be rebooted in parallel.

                        There's no way to specifically assign cluster nodes to specific update domains
                        in Azure.  This would have been nice for a cluster hosting replicated database
                        nodes where we'd like to assign replica nodes to different update domains such
                        that all data would still be available while an update domain was being rebooted.

                        I imagine Azure doesn't allow this due to the difficuilty of ensuring these
                        constraints across a very large number of customer deployments.  Azure also
                        mentions that the disruption of a VM for planned maintenance can be slight
                        because VMs can be relocated from one host to another while still running.

                        **NOTE:** Manager nodes are always deployed with 20 update domains and since no cluster
                        should ever need anywhere close this number of managers, we'll be ensured
                        that only a single manager will be rebooted together during planned Azure
                        maintenance and the 30 minutes Azure waits after rebooting an update domain
                        gives the rebooted manager a chance to rejoin the other managers and catch
                        up on any changes that happened while it was offline.

                        **NOTE:** NeonKUBE deploys manager and worker nodes in separate Azure availability zones.
                        This means that there will always be a quorum of managers available as any one
                        update zone is rebooted.
