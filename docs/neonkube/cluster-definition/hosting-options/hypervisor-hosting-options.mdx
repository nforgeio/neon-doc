# Common Hypervisor Hosting Options

The NEONKUBE on-premise **xenserver** hosting environment relies on the **hypervisorOptions**
to locate the host hypervisor servers where the cluster node VMs will be provisioned, including
their **hostname** (or ip addresses), **username** and **password** as well default VM settings such as
the number of **vCPUs**, **memory**, and **disk** respources to be assigned.  This can be overriden for
specific nodes.

Here's what the common on-premise Hypervisor related hosting options looks like, with the 
default values or **[required]** for property values that must be specified:

```yaml
hosting:
  hypervisor:
    diskLocation: null
    hosts:        [required]
    - address:    [required]
      name:       [required]
      username:   [required]
      password:   [required]
    hostUsername: null
    hostPassword: null
    memory:       16 GiB
    namePrefix:   [CLUSTERNAME-]
    openEbsDisk:  128 GiB
    osDisk:       128 GiB
    vcpus:        4
```

                                `string:` Specifies the path to the location where virtual machine hard disk will be created.
                                 This defaults to the local Hyper-V folder for Windows.

                                This is currently recognized only when deploying on a local Hyper-V hypervisor.
                                Eventually, you'll be able to specify a XenServer storage repository as well.

                            <td><b>hosts</b></td>
                            <td>
                                `array:` Specifies one or more target hypervisor servers for XenServer cluster deployments.
                                Cluster nodes will reference these hosts by name indicating that the node should be deployed
                                on the target hyoervisor.  This is required for XenServer deployments.

                                <u>**address**</u>

                                Specifies the IP address or FQDN of the hypervisor machine.

                                <u>**name**</u>

                                Specifies the hypervisor host name.  This is used to by <see cref="NodeDefinition"/> instances
                                to specify where a cluster node is to be provisioned.

                                <u>**password**</u>

                                Specifies the custom password to use when connecting to the hypervisor machine.  This
                                overrides **hosting.hypervisor.hostPassword**.

                                <u>**username**</u>

                                Specifies the custom username to use when connecting to the hypervisor machine.  This
                                overrides **hosting.hypervisor.hostUsername**.

                                `string:` Specifies the default username to use for connecting to hypervisor host machines 
                                specified by **hosts**.   This may be overridden for specific hypervisor machines.
                                
                                **NOTE:** This defaults to **root** for XenServer based environments, **null** otherwise.

                                `string:`  Specifies the default password to use for connecting to hypervisor host machines 
                                specified by **hosts**.  This may be overridden for specific hypervisor machines within **hosts**
                                items.  This defaults to **null**.

                                `string:` Specifies the default amount of memory to allocate to each cluster virtual machine.  
                                This is specified as a string that can be a byte count or a number with units like <b>512MiB</b>,
                                <b>0.5GiB</b>, <b>2iGB</b>, or <b>1TiB</b>.  This defaults to <b>4GiB</b>.

                                `string:` The prefix to be prepended to virtual machine provisioned to hypervisors for the
                                **xenserver** enmvironment.  This is used to avoid VM naming conflicts between different clusters.

                                When this is **null** (the default), the cluster name followed by a dash will 
                                prefix the provisioned virtual machine names.  When this is a non-empty string, the
                                value followed by a dash will be used.  If this is an empty string or whitespace then
                                the machine names will not be prefixed.

                                **NOTE:** Virtual machine name prefixes will always be converted to lowercase.

                                **NOTE:** This property is ignored for cloud hosting environments because cluster VMs will be
                                isolated in their own resource groups and private networks.
