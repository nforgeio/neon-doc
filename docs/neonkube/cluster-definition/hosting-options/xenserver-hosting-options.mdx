# XenServer/XCP-ng Hosting Options

Here's what the XenServer/XCP-ng related hosting options looks like, with the default values or **[required]** for
property values that must be specified:

```yaml
hosting:
  environment:         xenserver
  hypervisor:
    snapshot:          false
    storageRepository: "local storage"
```

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td><b>snapshot</b></td>
        <td>
            `bool:` Optionally directs XenServer to create the virtual machines using a snapshot of
            the virtual machine template rather than creating a full copy.  This defaults to **false**.

            Virtual machines created via a snapshot will be ready within seconds where as
            creation can take something like 4 minutes on a SSD or 9 minutes on a spinning
            drive.  We don't enable snapshots though by default, because some web posts
            from around 2014 indicate that operators may encounter problems when something
            like multiple virtual machines have been created as snapshots from the same template.

            We figure that it's best to default to safe setting for production clusters and
            then allow operators to override this when provisioning temporary test clusters
            or when provisioning on a storage repository that doesn't have these limitations.

            For snapshots to work, the storage repository must support them and the virtual
            machine template must reside in the same repository where the virtual machines
            are being created.  The current **neon-cli** implementation persists the
            cluster VM templates to the local storage repository, so support for non-local
            storage repositories is not supported out-of-the-box at this time.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>storageRepository</b></td>
        <td>
            `string:` Specifies the XenServer storage repository to be used to store the XenServer
                node template as well as the cluster virtual machine images.  This defaults to
            **Local storage**.
