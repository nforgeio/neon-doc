# Node Definitions

Describes the machines that need to be deployed for a NeonKUBE cluster. This is a map with the machine hostnames mapping
to an object specifying the requirements for each cluster node.

Here's what the node options look like, with the default values or **[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
nodes:
  my-node: {
    address:               null
    aws:
      instanceType:        null
      ebsOptimized:        "default"
      placementPartition:  0
      volumeSize:          "default"
      storageType:         "default"
      diskSize:            null
      openEbsVolumeSize:   "default"
      openEbsStorageType:  "default"
      openEbsdiskSize:     null
    azure:
      vmSize:              null
      storageType:         "default"
      diskSize:            null
      openEbsStorageType: "default"
      openEbsDiskSize:     null
    hypervisor:
      host:                null
      vcpus:               0
      memory:              null
      osDisk:              null
      openEbsDisk:         null
    ingress:               false
    role:                  "worker"
    openEbsStorage:        false
    taints:                []
  }
}
```

The **address** property is required for on-premise hosting environments like **Hyper-V** and **XenServer/XCP-ng**. This
is optional for cloud environments like **AWS** and **Azure** where NeonKUBE will automatically assign IP addresses to
node, but you can also assign addresses to cloud nodes explicitly if you wish.

The **aws**, **azure**, and **hypervisor** allow you to override settings from the global cluster definition
**hosting.aws**, **hosting.azure**, **hosting.hyperv** and **hosting.xenserver** properties for individual cluster
nodes.

            to be automatically assigned durining cluster setup.

            This is required for on-premise clusters deployed to Hype-V or XenServer/XCP-ng
            but is optional for cloud deployments.

        <td>
            `object:` **AWS** specific options for the cluster node.  These options can be used to override
            defaults specified by **hosting.aws** in the cluster definition.  This is ignored
            for non-AWS deployments.

            ```yaml
            aws:
                ebsOptiomized:     "default"
                instanceType:      null

                volumeType:        "default"
            ```

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>Property</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>**ebsOptiomized**</td>
                    <td>
                    `string:` Non EBS optimized instances perform disk operation I/O to EBS volumes using the same
                    network used for other network operations.  This means that you may see some disk
                    performance declines when your instance is busy serving web traffic or running
                    database queries, etc.

                    EBS optimization can be enabled for some instance types.  This provisions extra dedicated
                    network bandwidth exclusively for EBS I/O.  Exactly how this works, depends on the specific
                    VM type.

                    More modern AWS VM types enable EBS optimization by default and you won't incur any
                    additional charges for these instances and disabling EBS optimization here or via
                    <see cref="AwsHostingOptions.DefaultEbsOptimized"/> won't have any effect.

                    Some AWS instance types can be optimized but this is disabled by default.  When you
                    enable this by setting the cluster definition's **hosting.aws.defaultEbsOptimized** or
                    this (**ebsOptiomized**) property to "true", you'll probably an additional AWS hourly fee for
                    these instances.

                    Some AWS instance types don't support EBS optimization.  You'll need take care to disable
                    **ebsOptiomized** for those nodes.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>**instanceType**</td>
                    <td>
                        `string:` Optionally specifies the type of ECB instance to provision for this node.
                        See [AWS Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for the instance
                        types currently supported by AWS.

                        **NOTE:** NeonKUBE clusters cannot be deployed to ARM-based AWS instance types.  You must
                        specify an instance type using a Intel or AMD 64-bit processor.

                        **NOTE:** NeonKUBE requires control-plane and worker instances to have at least 4 CPUs
                        and 8GiB RAM.  Choose an AWS instance type that satisfies these requirements.

                    <td>**placementPartition**</td>
                    <td>
                    `integer:` Optionally specifies the AWS placement group partition the node will be provisioned
                    within.  This is a **1-based** partition index which **defaults to 0**, indicating
                    that node placement will be handled automatically by AWS.

                    You generally don't need to customize this for control-plane nodes since there will generally
                    be a separate partition available for each control-plane and AWS will spread the instances
                    across these automatically.  When you specify this for control-plane nodes, the partition index
                    must be in the range of **1...hosting.aws.controlPlanePlacementPartitions**.

                    For some cluster scenarios like a noSQL database cluster, you may wish to explicitly
                    control the partition where specific worker nodes are provisioned.  For example, if
                    your database replcates data across multiple worker nodes, you'd like to have the
                    workers hosting the same data be provisioned to different partitions such that if
                    the workers in one partition are lost then the workers in the remaining partitions
                    will still be able to serve the data.

                    When you specify this for worker nodes, the partition index must be in the range
                    of **1...hosting.aws.workerPlanePlacementPartitions**.
