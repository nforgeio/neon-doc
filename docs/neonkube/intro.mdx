:::note
The current release is based on Kubernetes v1.24, which is somewhat dated. We're
in the process of upgrading to Kubernetes v1.29 and are also switching from the
Calico CNI to the [Cilium CNI](https://cilium.io/get-started/).

# Introduction

NeonKUBE is a full-stack, production-ready Kubernetes distribution that provides
a seamless and consistent developer experience across different environments.
Whether you want to run your applications on your laptop, on-premise servers or
on the cloud, NeonKUBE can help you deploy and manage clusters with ease.

Basic Kubernetes isn't really production ready because it doesn't include the
components required to manage clusters as well as other generally useful
features. Kubernetes distributions like NeonKUBE layer useful components onto
basic Kubernetes and also manage cluster deployment.

NeonKUBE curates several best-of-breed open source components and implements
cluster deployment to a Windows workstation or laptop, on-premise using
[XenServer](https://www.xenserver.com/) or a free and compaitible open source
alternative [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/).

With NeonKUBE, you will enjoy benefits like:

- **Simplicity:** You don't have to worry about installing and configuring
  dozens of different tools and components. NeonKUBE handles all of that.

- **Consistency:** You don't have to deal with different versions or
  configurations of Kubernetes or its add-ons across different environments or
  platforms. You can use the same NeonKUBE distribution everywhere.

- **Reliability:** You don't have to worry about compatibility issues or bugs
  caused by mismatched components or dependencies. You can rely on NeonKUBE's
  tested and stable components.

- **Productivity**: You don't have to waste time on tedious tasks like setting
  up VPNs or SSH tunnels. You can use NeonDESKTOP's intuitive interface or
  NeonCLI's powerful commands to access and manage your cluster easily.

## NeonDESKTOP and NeonCLI

**NeonKUBE** provides two ways to deploy and interact with Kubernetes clusters.
**NeonDESKTOP** is a Microsoft Windows GUI application that can deploy and
manage a local single node cluster on a laptop or workstation with a **500GB+
SSD** and at least **32GB RAM**. We're planning on eventually releasing
NeonDESKTOP for MacOS and perhaps eventually for Linux Desktop.

**NeonCLI** is our command line management tool. This is a gently customized
version of the standard Kubernetes **kubectl** tool, including all of the
standard commands as well as new NeonKUBE-specific commands.

**NeonDESKTOP** is similar to **Docker Desktop** in Kubernetes mode in that it
can manage a single node cluster on your computer, but **NeonDESKTOP** deploys a
full-stack cluster with the curated components. NeonDESKTOP clusters are
intended for learning about Kubernetes and these components and doing some lite
development. NeonDESKTOP clusters are **not intended for production**.

We publish two installers, one for NeonDESKTOP which also includes NeonCLI and
another that installs only NeonCLI.
